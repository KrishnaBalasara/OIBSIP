                <h2 class="text">About</h2>
                <p style="font-size:18px; text-align: justify;">Elon Reeve Musk is a business magnate and investor. He is
                    the founder, CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX, angel investor, CEO and product architect of Tesla,
                    Inc. owner and CEO of Twitter, founder of the Boring Company, co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI,
                    and president of the philanthropic Musk Foundation.</p>
                <p style="font-size:18px; text-align: justify;">With an estimated net worth of around $192
                    billion as of March 27, 2023, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX, Musk is
                    the second-wealthiest person in the world, according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and
                    Forbes's real-time billionaires list.</p>
                
                <!-- Easrly life section -->
                <h2 class="text">Early Life</h2>
                <p style="font-size:18px;text-align: justify;">Musk was born in Canada to a Canadian mother and a South African father. Musk grew up with his head
                    stuck in books and computers. He was bullied by his classmates and often beaten up by class bullies
                    as a little, timid youngster until he grew strong enough to defend himself during a growth spurt in
                    his teens.</p> 
                <p style="font-size:18px; text-align: justify;">He developed a video game at the age of 12 and sold it to a computer magazine. Musk left
                    South Africa in 1988 after getting a Canadian passport because he refused to support apartheid
                    through compulsory military duty and wanted to pursue the higher economic prospects offered in the
                    United States.</p>

                <!-- Qualification section -->
                <h2 class="text">Qualification</h2>
                <p style="font-size:18px; text-align: justify;">Musk travelled to Canada at the age of 17 to attend Queen's University and evade military service in
                    South Africa. Musk got his Canadian citizenship the same year, partly because he thought it would be
                    easier to get American citizenship that way. Musk moved to the United States in 1992 to study
                    business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p style="font-size:18px; text-align: justify;"> He earned an undergraduate degree in
                    economics before continuing on to earn a second bachelor's degree in physics. Musk went to Stanford
                    University in California to earn a Ph.D. in energy physics after leaving Penn. But that Ph.D
                    couldn’t make it to Elon Musk Degrees since he walked out of Stanford after only two days to start
                    his first firm.</p>

                <!-- Work section -->
                <h2 class="text">Works</h2>
                <p style="font-size:18px;text-align: justify;">Elon Musk's entrepreneurial journey began in 1995 when he dropped out of Stanford's PhD program after
                    just two days to create Zip2, an online business directory with maps, with his younger brother. They
                    worked tirelessly to develop and grow the company, eventually recruiting angel investors and turning
                    it into a profitable firm. After selling Zip2 for $307 million in 1999, Musk founded X.com, which
                    later merged with Confinity to become PayPal. When eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002, Musk
                    became a millionaire at the age of 31.</p>
                <p style="font-size:18px;text-align: justify;">
                    Since then, Musk has been focused on addressing some of humanity's most pressing existential risks.
                    He founded SpaceX, a private space exploration company, to make humanity a multi-planetary species
                    and reduce the risk of single-planet dependency. He also founded Tesla Motors, which aims to
                    accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy and reduce the risk of climate change. Both
                    companies required Musk to risk his entire early fortune, but he remained committed to his vision.
                    Overall, Musk's journey shows how relentless pursuit of one's vision can lead to groundbreaking
                    innovation</p>
                
                <!-- Success story section -->
                <h2 class="text">Success Story</h2>
                <p style="font-size:18px;text-align: justify;">Elon Musk played a crucial role in the development of the Tesla Roadster, the world's first electric
                    vehicle, as a part of Tesla Motors, where he later took over as CEO and product architect. Tesla has
                    become one of the most sought-after car brands under his leadership. Musk's SpaceX has also gained
                    recognition for signing high-profile contracts with NASA and the US Air Force to manufacture rockets
                    and carry out military missions. He aims to collaborate with NASA for a Mars mission by 2025.</p>
                <p style="font-size:18px;text-align: justify;">Additionally, Tesla has expanded into the solar energy sector after purchasing SolarCity, a
                    clean-energy services company that develops rechargeable solar batteries for residential and
                    business use. The Powerwall is designed for residential backup power and off-grid use, whereas the
                    Powerpack is designed for electric utility grid use.</p>
